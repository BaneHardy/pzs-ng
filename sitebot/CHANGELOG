---- BELOW IS DAXXARS CHANGELOG FOR "DAXPATCH"! (merged with TNG)

v0.0.3 daxpatch
 - separated config from the main file, most editing is now done in dZSbconf.tcl
   (you still use "source scripts/dZSbot.tcl" in eggdropconfig)
 - added a lot of comments to config (easier for newbies)
 - cleaned up indenting etc ;) (yes, its most likely a question of taste)
 - changed freespace announce costumizability =) (see announce(FREE) and announce(FREE-DEV))
 - added a small fix for the readlog-proc, now it wont start more than one timer :)
   (rehashing your eggdrop caused a problem before, it started more readlog-timers)
 - first version released in daxpatch ;)
 - added checking if all binaries specified in the "binary" array is executable
 - made <cmdpre>help replace %cmdpre in dZSbot.help with the actual cmd prefix =)
 - small mod to top.tcl to make it kill extra timers;)
