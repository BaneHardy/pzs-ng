 1. Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-1 Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Copy necessary files to your bot's script dir:
   cp dZSbot.tcl /path/to/egg/scripts/
   cp dZSbot.help /path/to/egg/scripts/
   cp dZSbconf.tcl.dist /path/to/egg/scripts/dZSbconf.tcl
   cp dZSbvars.tcl.dist /path/to/egg/scripts/dZSbvars.tcl
   cp *.zst /path/to/egg/scripts/

 Edit dZSbconf.tcl to match your setup, and enter the name of a theme (.zst)
 you wish to use.
 Edit the theme you wish to use to match your setup, or make your own.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-2 Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Directory "src" contains ng-bw and passchk. These are compiled from root
 makefile. Anyhow - you can always compile these seperately by issuing
 "make" and "make install" inside this dir.
 
 ng-bw:   Used for !bw !bwup !bwdn
 passchk: Used for !invite to validate passwd (requires openssl header files)
 
 Directory "extra" contains helper scripts for use with the sitebot.
 
 fakelog.sh:         Use this to simulate log entries.
 incomplete-list.sh: The bot can show a list of incompletes for each section
                     defined in the actual script. (remember to edit sections)
 invite.sh:          This is used with custom command "site invite".
                     Add the following to glftpd.conf:
                     site_cmd        INVITE  EXEC    /bin/invite.sh
                     custom-invite   !8 *
 weektop.sh:         Use at will :)
 top.tcl:            Load this in your eggdrop.conf like:
                     source scripts/top.tcl (edit #chan first)
                     
 Directory "ngplugins" contains plugins for the bot in development.
 This dir is not an active part of pzs-ng (yet).
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-3 Using with eggdrop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Load the sitebot like any other script. Add this to eggdrop.conf:
 
 source scripts/dZSbot.tcl (or any other path you choose)

 (Re)start your eggdrop!
 
 In details:

 For first install you need to copy dZSbconf.tcl.dist to dZSbconf.tcl and
 make sure to include dZSbot.help for !help to work.
 
 To upgrade later - you only need to copy dZSbot.tcl and maybe dZSbot.help.
 Always check the changelog to be sure you have all possible settings reflected
 in your installed dZSbconf.tcl.

 Files "*.zst" is theme files and was introduced with pzs-ng and heavily
 extended in beta3. You can change them to your liking but it is suggested
 that you simply make a copy of the bundled themes if you want to change
 anything. Read more about themes in the chapter "Themes" in this file.
 
 When installing the sitebot for the first time it will look for default.zst.
 You need to copy this yourself "cp default.zst.dist default.zst".
 If the sitebot cannot find the default.zst file it will try to load
 default.zst.dist and fail to work if it's missing :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2. Themes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2-1 Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To install a theme - all you need to do is edit dZSbconf.tcl and change a line:
 set announce(THEMEFILE) "yourtheme.zst"

 dZSbot is looking for the theme in its own path by default. However - you can
 supply a full path if this is preferred for whatever obscure reason :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2-2 Bundled themes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When writing this - we only have 2 working themes bundled:

 default.zst.dist: Previously known as avizion.zst which was made to test the
                   new way of using themes and to show "all" possible outputs.
                   Use this as a reference when making your own themes.

 psxc.zst:         psxc thought he needed more colours - so he made his own
                   theme based on default.zst.dist (avizion.zst at that time).

 classic.zst.dist: This theme is currently outdated but still included for
                   nostalgic reasons. We may update this to work with the new
                   dZSbot - but more on that later.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2-3 Customizing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Feel free to edit and customize any of the bundled themes, but it is advised
 for you to make a copy first. Maybe do "cp default.zst.dist mytheme.zst" before
 raping the theme to suit your needs.

 Using colours is fairly simple in dZSbot now. Simply define a new colour like:

 COLOR1 = "04"
 ..
 COLOR4 = "07"

 Then use it on the .zst file like:

 announce.SOMETHING = "[%c4{%section}] %c2{Something happend} in %c1{%pf}"

 Colour table for use in TCL:

 00 white                 08 yellow
 01 black                 09 light green
 02 blue                  10 cyan
 03 green                 11 light cyan
 04 light red             12 light blue
 05 red                   13 light magenta
 06 magenta (purple)      14 gray
 07 orange (dark yellow)  15 light gray

 NOTE: dZSbot does only support 9 colours max per theme.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2-4 Submit your theme?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Did you make your own theme - and is it ready for the public?

 We dare you to submit it to the project... in the spirit of open source :)
