 1-1 Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Please edit the actual file dZSbconf.tcl for general setup and hints.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-2 Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Directory "src" contains ng-bw and passchk. These are compiled from root
 makefile. Anyhow - you can always compile these seperately by issuing
 "make" and "make install" inside this dir.
 
 ng-bw:   Used for !bw !bwup !bwdn
 passchk: Used for !invite to validate passwd (requires openssl header files)
 
 Directory "extra" contains helper scripts for use with the sitebot.
 
 fakelog.sh:         Use this to simulate log entries.
 incomplete-list.sh: The bot can show a list of incompletes for each section
                     defined in the actual script. (remember to edit sections)
 invite.sh:          This is used with custom command "site invite".
                     Add the following to glftpd.conf:
                     site_cmd        INVITE  EXEC    /bin/invite.sh
                     custom-invite   !8 *
 weektop.sh:         Use at will :)
 top.tcl:            Load this in your eggdrop.conf like:
                     source scripts/top.tcl (edit #chan first)
                     
 Directory "ngplugins" contains plugins for the bot in development.
 This dir is not an active part of pzs-ng (yet).
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-3 Using with eggdrop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Load the sitebot like any other script. Add this to eggdrop.conf:
 
 source scripts/dZSbot.tcl (or any other path you choose)
 
 For first install you need to copy dZSbconf.tcl.dist to dZSbconf.tcl and
 make sure to include dZSbot.help for !help to work.
 
 To upgrade later - you only need to copy dZSbot.tcl and maybe dZSbot.help.
 Always check the changelog to be sure you have all possible settings reflected
 in your installed dZSbconf.tcl.

 Files "*.zst" is theme files and was introduced with pzs-ng and heavily
 extended in beta3. You can change them to your liking but it is suggested
 that you simply make a copy of the bundled themes if you want to change
 anything.
 
 When installing the sitebot for the first time it will look for default.zst.
 You need to copy this yourself "cp default.zst.dist default.zst".
 If the sitebot cannot find the default.zst file it will try to load
 default.zst.dist and fail to work if it's missing :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1-4 Cryptic errors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "You didn't sacrifice a lamb like you were told, did you?"
  - read 1-3, you need to put dZSbconf.tcl in the proper location! ;)
 "Blood has been spilled this night. (<something>)"
  - the binary specified in 'set binary(<something>)' does not exist or is not
    executable by the eggdrop.
