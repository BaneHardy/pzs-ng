This is a simple script meant to help debug scripts supposed to run in chroot.
stuff run in chroot usually isn't run as root, but it can be hard to debug
such stuff. By using this small util you can execute what you want, with the
uid of your choice.

How to compile:
gcc -static -o /glftpd/bin/droproot droproot.c

How to run:
chroot /glftpd /bin/droproot <number> "something to run"

Number must be between 1 and 65535.
The "" is only needed if you wish to pass args to the script you wish to
test.
Examples:
chroot /glftpd /bin/droproot 200 /bin/my_script.sh             <- valid - no args
chroot /glftpd /bin/droproot 200 /bin/my_script.sh l33tuser    <- invalid - arg will not be passed.
chroot /glftpd /bin/droproot 200 "/bin/my_script.sh l33tuser"  <- valid - arg will be passed.
