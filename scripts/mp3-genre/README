pzs-ng allows you to change the uid/gid of files/dirs with a bin called ng-chown.
By default this binary is disabled in all aspects.
You may use it to change the groupname in a dirlisting to match the genre of a
mp3-release, by adding the following in your zsconfig.h:

#define enable_complete_script          TRUE
#define complete_script                 "/bin/nfoextract.sh"
#define enable_mp3_script               TRUE
#define mp3_script                      "/bin/ng-chown"
#define mp3_script_cookies              "0 0 0 1 1 1 - \"%w\" ."
#define allow_gid_change_in_ng_chown    TRUE
#define allow_dir_chown_in_ng_chown     TRUE

Please copy/paste the exact lines above. This will enable the mp3-script, and
make ng-chown able to modify the group id of the releasedir.

You must also chmod +s ng-chown:
   chmod +s /glftpd/bin/ng-chown

Last, you'll have to add the genres into glftpd's groupfile. This is what the
script named mp3-genre-create.sh does. Just run it and it will modify the group
file (after creating a backup).
