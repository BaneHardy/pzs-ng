AUDIO-GENRE
-----------

pzs-ng allows you to change the uid/gid of files/dirs with a bin called ng-chown.
By default this binary is disabled in all aspects.
You may use it to change the groupname in a dirlisting to match the genre of an
audio-release, by adding the following in your zsconfig.h:

#define enable_audio_script             TRUE
#define audio_script                    "/bin/ng-chown"
#define audio_script_cookies            "0 0 0 1 0 1 - \"%w\" \"%?\""
#define allow_gid_change_in_ng_chown    TRUE
#define allow_dir_chown_in_ng_chown     TRUE

Please copy/paste the exact lines above. This will enable the audio-script, and
make ng-chown able to modify the group id of the releasedir.

You must also chmod +s ng-chown:
   chmod +s /glftpd/bin/ng-chown

Last, you'll have to add the genres into glftpd's groupfile. This is what the
script named audio-genre-create.sh does. Just run it and it will modify the group
file (after creating a backup).

For those wanting an explanation of the cookies/variables passed:
  0      - uid set to 0 - this disable the uid setting.
  0      - gid set to 0 - this disable the gid setting.
  0      - do not change uid of files/dirs. We only wants to change group.
  1      - change gid of the file/dirs.
  0      - do not change ownership of files in a dir we specify.
  1      - change ownership of dir/file we specify.
  -      - disable user name lookup.
  \"%w\" - genre name used as group-name. This will be used since gid = 0
           earlier. We use quotes since the name may have space chars.
  \"%?\" - current path - this is the dir we wish to chown.

SOOO... WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS?

Well, changing the gid of an audio-dir to the genre allows you to easily sort dirs
accordingly. Somesites only allow certain genres, or does not allow some. To the
rescue comes this little handt script. :) Make your curries/leechers happy.
