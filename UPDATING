UPDATING BETWEEN VERSIONS/REVISIONS
-----------------------------------

There seems to be much confusion about updating. The general idea is as follows:

Keep zsconfig.h and dZSBconf.tcl

These are your config files. There is no need to redo the config files each time
you update your zipscript/bot. I'll say again: THERE IS NO NEED TO REDO THE
CONFIG FILES EACH TIME YOU UPGRADE.

Okay, now that that is clear, here's the general process:

1.  download/unpack the latest version/revision.
2.  copy your old zsconfig.h into zipscript/conf/
3.  make distclean; ./configure && make && make install
3a. chmod +s /glftpd/bin/ng-chown (optional, only if you use it)
4.  cp sitebot dZSb* /path/to/sitebot/scripts/pzs-ng/
5.  .rehash or .restart your bot.

6.  If you're upgrading from -1277 to +1277, you need to
    rm -rf ftp-data/psz-ng/*

That's it! You've upgraded.
Any new additions/changes to either the sitebot or the zipscript is used with
default values - your bot/zipscript will not break.

In case you're wondering about step 4 above - no, it will not overwrite your
config - there is no dZSBconf.tcl in the archive. The above cp command is
quite safe to use.

Themes - these will be updated from time to time. Themes in general should
continue to work as they always have.


ANY CHANGES THAT DEVIATE FROM THE ABOVE IS LISTED BELOW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

zsconfig.h:	The option 'del_progressmeter' has changed. Make sure you have
		two percentage signs '%%' in it. See README.ZSCONFIG for more
		info. Optionally, just remove the option from your config, and
		the default will be used.
		Changed in: r827

		The options 'cleanup_yesterday' and 'cleanup_today' is gone and
		is replaced by 'days_back_cleanup'. The option 'cleanupdirs' is
		split in two, 'cleanupdirs' and 'cleanupdirs_dated'.
		Changed in: r1273

dZSBconf.tcl	A dZSBconf.defaults.tcl first appeared in r1120 - if your bot
		is older than this, it is recommended to update all, including
		dZSBconf.tcl
