	  zipscript: remove: config setting - lock_optimize
	  zipscript: remove: config setting - ignore_lock_timeout
	  zipscript: change: replaced the complex file locking mechanism with an easier one, to keep unwanted bugs out.
	  zipscript: new: config setting - max_age_for_lock_file which specifies how old a lock file can be before it's ignored.
	  zipscript: new: added the option debug_level which specifies the verbosity of debug messages.
	  zipscript: change: removed the ss5 specific code from all, except sitewho. This means that the output to the bot is no longer ss5 compatible.
	  zipscript: new: feature to use filetypes instf dirs when creating no-nfo symlinks.
	  zipscript: new: rescan got some options - rescan <filename>, rescan "<filename*>", rescan --quick
	  zipscript: change: sitewho now uses the conf to find the gl version, or can auto-detect it.
	  zipscript: change: announce cookies changed.
	  bot: change: the bot use the new cookies.
	  zipscript: new: smart sfv checking - "bad" entries in a sfv will be ignored. "bad" files that was in the original sfv, if uploaded, will be allowed.
	  zipscript: new: rewrite/update the sfv if "bad" entries are found.
	  zipscript: new: allow sfv with a filename w/00000000 as crc - crc will be calced by the zipscript, and the crc written to the sfv.
	  zipscript: fix: the average bitrate for a full audio-release is used at the end of a race.
	  zipscript: new: the cleanup binary got a command line override for days back to cleanup

	  zipscript: new: added support for execution of external script on banned releases.
	  zipscript: new: added support for speedtests
	  zipscript: new: if sfv_cleanup is set to true, the original sfv is copied to the storage dir (backup). Rescan will use the original sfv (re-copy it to the releasdir before performing a new cleanup).
	  zipscript: new: deny/allow mp3 releases based on vbr preset.
	  zipscript: new: config setting - audio_allowed_vbr_preset_check

	  zipscript: new: config setting - deny_nfo_upload_in_zip
	  zipscript: change: we no longer format the time output - all is in seconds.
	  zipscript: fix: when making mp3-symlinks, it is case insensitive regarding subdir, meaning it will not make a dir named GrP if GRP already exists, but put the symlink to Release-GrP in GRP/
	  zipscript: new: support for zipcleanup - will remove unwanted files from zipfiles. See http://project-sl.swecheck.net for more info.

	suggest you read README.ZSCONFIG for the zipscript, and

			codechanges not directly related to config options:
			---------------------------------------------------
			- glftpd v1.xx and 2.xx supported.
			- the 4GB limit has been removed.
			- max number of files in a release has been changed from 100 to 1024 - this limit can easily be changed later.
			- support for sections added.
			- the shared memory dependency has been removed. This means that it will work on any glftpd version, or other ftpd.
			- some cookies has changed, others removed or added.
			- output to glftpd.log is no longer user-formatted - instead raw cookies are logged.
			- major rewrites removed all known memory leaks and possible core reasons.
			- debug output is vastly improved.
			- mp3 vbr support is added.
			- portability has improved - the most popular platforms are supported.
			- partial amd64-support - you need to compile in m32 mode, but the zipscript works.
			- smart handling of double sfv make sure a false sfv isn't uploaded.
			- improved handling of sfv content.
			- a locking mechanism is added, which prevent race conditions and wrongly marked incomplete releases.
			- the crc table was replaced with a better/correct one, which helps on large file releases.
			- all bins are changed to run under chroot only.
			- cleanup now removes broken links and lists incomplete releases
			- compile options like --with-ss5 give ss5 support.
			- the zipscript will calculate the crc of the file if no crc (0) is sent from glftpd.
			- cleanup now works as a cscript to 'site nuke' and 'site wipe'
			- datacleaner now works as a cscript to 'RMD' and 'site nuke'
			- a banned (mp3)-release can be deleted automatically after first file, saving bw and hd-space.
			- ng-chown (a new bin) allows you to chown files/dirs. An example of its use is included.
			- ng-undupe (a new bin) will undupe files that fail (on rescan for instance) allowing the file to be re-uploaded.
			- upgrading is easy - there is no need to rewrite the config for each upgrade - just copy it over.
			- zsconfig.h now only holds changes to the defaults, ie on upgrades new options will be used with default values.
			- the zipscript can be run from (chroot'ed) shell, allowing for easier debugging (and execution from scripts).
			- rescan is "safe" - it will not remove files that are being uploaded.


		----	Changes in the sitebot:

			Numerous new IRC commands: !leechers, !idlers, !uploaders,
			!new, !nukes, !unnukes, !search, and !uptime.

			A new plug-in system, which makes it easier for users to
			add custom features without having to directly modify the
			source files. There are several example plug-ins included;
			such as a pre-time check, channel kick on deluser, and
			an IRC nick to FTP user mapping plug-in.

			Invite users to private channels based on their name,
			group, or flags. For example, one could invite all
			users with the "1" flag to #Staff.

			dZSbot can announce sysop.log and login.log events, or
			redirect them to your staff channel.

			The FTP bouncer check now supports explicit secure connections,
			commonly referred to as "AUTH TLS".

			The bot now uses a theming system to customize channel
			announces. A preview system is included allowing you
			to view your theme before using it.

			Easier configuration - if an option isn't defined the
			default value will be used. This makes upgrading much easier,
			since there's no need to reconfigure the bot for each update.

			Full support for glftpd v1.x and v2.x.

			Better error control - instead of crashing, the bot
			will output what's wrong in the party line.


		----	Changes in sitebot scripts/addons:

			A few new scripts have been added.

			Some scripts have been revised, others rewritten.


		----	Changes in sitewho:

			A lot of the code have been rewritten.

			A few new options have been added.

			Full support for glftpd v1.x and v2.x.


		----	Changes in scripts/:

			A few scripts have been removed, other added and some
			revised/rewritten/replaced.
