status  who       what
 [x]     psxc      change "VBR" to real bps number (average)
 [!]     psxc      add a cleaner script/bin for the zipscript dir in ftp-data - to run in crontab
                   - not needed
 [x]     iono      fix NUKE/UNNUKE in dZSbot.tcl for glftpd2 output
 [/]     all       write documentation for different things (especially dZSbot (comments?))
 [/]     daxxar    add theme-support to dZSbot.tcl, so that it reads an external theme file. (theme/skin)
 [ ]     daxxar    make a config-file format that is parsed to .h, instead of people editing .h :-)
 [?]     psxc      add option to use average/median on vbr mp3's?
                   - would there be any benefit from this? Scrap it?
 [?]     pending   check the mp3 patch - does it check all files (YES)? can we save this info and use it later?
                   - would there be any benefit from this? Scrap it?
 [x]     psxc      warn_genres and warn_bitrates option in zsconfig.h (output to gllog)
 [ ]     daxxar    hybrid_types, are allowed if no sfv, will be checked against sfv if there is one.
