  --- TODO ---
  - this is a list of planned changes to zs-c :)
  - devs: please update frequently with ideas / progress :-)

[x] change "VBR" to real bps number (average)
[ ] add a cleaner script/bin for the zipscript dir in ftp-data - to run in crontab
[ ] fix NUKE/UNNUKE in dZSbot.tcl for glftpd2 output
[ ] write documentation for different things (especially dZSbot (comments?))
[ ] add theme-support to dZSbot.tcl, so that it reads an external theme file. (theme/skin)
[ ] make a config-file format that is parsed to .h, instead of people editing .h :-)
[ ] add option to use average/median on vbr mp3's?
[ ] check the mp3 patch - does it check all files? can we save this info and use it later?
