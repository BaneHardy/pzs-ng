  -- TODO
  - this is a list of planned changes to zs-c :)
  - devs: please update frequently with ideas / progress :-)

status  who       what
 [x]     psxc      change "VBR" to real bps number (average)
 [x]     psxc      warn_genres and warn_bitrates option in zsconfig.h (output to gllog)
 [x]     iono      fix NUKE/UNNUKE in dZSbot.tcl for glftpd2 output
 [x]     daxxar    add theme-support to dZSbot.tcl, so that it reads an external theme file. (theme/skin)
                   - does it need more features? more testing atleast.
				   - can you easily crash the eggie with malformed themes?
 [?]     psxc      add option to use average/median on vbr mp3's?
                   - would there be any benefit from this? Scrap it?
 [?]     pending   check the mp3 patch - does it check all files (YES)? can we save this info and use it later?
                   - would there be any benefit from this? Scrap it?
 [!]     psxc      add a cleaner script/bin for the zipscript dir in ftp-data - to run in crontab
                   - not needed
 [/]     daxxar    zipscript reports wrong sample rate (48khz instf 44.1khz etc) - why? mp3info reports correctly.
 [/]     all       write documentation for different things (especially dZSbot (comments?))
 [ ]               make a good-looking default theme for the zs. ask some 'fan/supporter' to do it?
 [ ]     daxxar    make a config-file format that is parsed to .h, instead of people editing .h :-)
 [ ]               hybrid_types, are allowed if no sfv, will be checked against sfv if there is one.
 [x]     iwdisb    fix a coredump when the user is killed/kicked on upload.
 [ ]               use mp3info as much as possible to get mp3 info.
 [ ]               add anonymity support - chown files/dirs as they are uploaded to a "special" user (will only
                   work if zs-c is +s)
 [ ]     freezy3k  fix solaris compatability.
 [x]     psxc      fix bug(?) in Sort.By.Artist (not confirmed - Joeed reported this from r140 - fails to compile)
 [ ]               ignore setting in allowed.bitrates if mp3 is vbr
 [ ]               fix the %U cookie in message_group_footer (should be "user/group", not "user")
 [ ]               compare the list of files stored in .rar to what's in the .sfv --> channel message if they differ.
