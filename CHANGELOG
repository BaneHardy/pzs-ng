PZS-NG CHANGELOG
----------------

v0.6.1	--> 1.00  :	The changes from the original project-zs by d1 is
			significant. There is nearly no code that has not been
			changed. For a full list of new/changed options, i
			suggest you read README.ZSCONFIG for the zipscript, and
			look at the README for the sitebot. Sitewho has also
			changed a lot and have been given a few new options, so
			check the sitebot.conf and the README.

			In total, there has been nearly 1600 code updates, so
			i won't list all of those here. I'll just include what
			changes are major ones, not including new config
			options.


		----	Changes in the zipscript:

			The entire codebase has been revised/updated/rewritten.

			A locking mechanism has been put in, to stop race
			conditions - this should help busy sites, since the
			need to rescan releases is diminished.

			Log output has changed dramatically - instead of logging
			full lines the bot picks up and pastes in chan, the
			zipscript only sends the data in cookie format.

			The zipscript is detached from the shared memory used
			by glftpd. What this means is that the zipscript will
			work on any glftpd version - past, present and even
			future versions.

			Better logging and error reports - it should be much
			simpler to find out where things go wrong.

			Cleaner code - it should now run on most platforms
			(most, as in all linux distro's, the *bsd's and a
			few others - we haven't tested all, so feel free to
			let us know if you do).

			The config is cleaner and easier. If a value is not
			included, the default for that value will be used.
			This results in fewer messed-up configs, and upgrades
			will go much smoother, since you do not have to
			rewrite your config each time.


		----	Changes in zipscript addons (rescan/postdel etc):

			Again, the code has been updated/revised/rewritten.

			New options have been added - see README for details.


		----	Changes in the sitebot:

			Much have been rewritten/revised.

			The bot now uses themes as templates for the output
			in channel.

			Easier config - if not all options is present, the
			default for the missing values will be used. This makes
			upgrading easier too, since there's no need to rewrite
			the config for each update.

			glftpd 1/2 support.

			Better error control - instead of crashing, the bot
			will output what's wrong in the partyline.


		----	Changes in sitebot scripts/addons:

			A few new scripts have been added.

			Some scripts have been revised, others rewritten.


		----	Changes in sitewho:

			A lot of the code have been rewritten.

			A few new options have been added.

			Autodetection of glftpd version has been added, meaning
			that it should work on any glftpd version (if you
			upgrade glftpd, sitewho will still work).


		----	Changes in scripts/:

			A few scripts have been removed, other added and some
			revised/rewritten/replaced.
