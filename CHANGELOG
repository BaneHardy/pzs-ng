PZS-NG CHANGELOG
----------------

v0.6.1	--> 1.00  :	The changes from the original project-zs by d1 is
			significant. There is nearly no code that has not been
			changed. For a full list of new/changed options, i
			suggest you read README.ZSCONFIG for the zipscript, and
			look at the README for the sitebot. Sitewho has also
			changed a lot and have been given a few new options, so
			check the sitebot.conf and the README.

			In total, there has been nearly 1600 code updates, so
			i won't list all of those here. I'll just include what
			changes are major ones, not including new config
			options.

			codechanges not directly related to config options:
			---------------------------------------------------
			- the 4GB limit has been removed
			- max number of files in a release has been changed from 100 to 1024 - this limit can easily be changed later.
			- support for sections added.
			- the shared memory dependency has been removed. This means that it will work on any glftpd version, or other ftpd.
			- some cookies has changed, others removed or added.
			- output to glftpd.log is no longer user-formatted - instead raw cookies are logged.
			- major rewrites removed all known memory leaks and possible core reasons.
			- debug output is vastly improved.
			- mp3 vbr support is added.
			- portability has improved - the most popular platforms are supported.
			- partial amd64-support - you need to compile in m32 mode, but the zipscript works.
			- smart handling of double sfv make sure a false sfv isn't uploaded.
			- improved handling of sfv content.
			- a locking mechanism is added, which prevent race conditions and wrongly marked incomplete releases.
			- the crc table was replaced with a better/correct one, which helps on large file releases.
			- all bins are changed to run under chroot only.
			- cleanup now removes broken links and lists incomplete releases
			- compile options like --with-ss5 give ss5 support.
			- the zipscript will calculate the crc of the file if no crc (0) is sent from glftpd.
			- cleanup now works as a cscript to 'site nuke' and 'site wipe'
			- datacleaner now works as a cscript to 'RMD' and 'site nuke'
			- a banned (mp3)-release can be deleted automatically after first file, saving bw and hd-space.
			- ng-chown (a new bin) allows you to chown files/dirs. An example of its use is included.
			- ng-undupe (a new bin) will undupe files that fail (on rescan for instance) allowing the file to be re-uploaded.



		----	Changes in the sitebot:

			Much have been rewritten/revised.

			The bot now uses themes as templates for the output
			in channel.

			Easier config - if not all options is present, the
			default for the missing values will be used. This makes
			upgrading easier too, since there's no need to rewrite
			the config for each update.

			glftpd 1/2 support.

			Better error control - instead of crashing, the bot
			will output what's wrong in the partyline.


		----	Changes in sitebot scripts/addons:

			A few new scripts have been added.

			Some scripts have been revised, others rewritten.


		----	Changes in sitewho:

			A lot of the code have been rewritten.

			A few new options have been added.

			Autodetection of glftpd version has been added, meaning
			that it should work on any glftpd version (if you
			upgrade glftpd, sitewho will still work).


		----	Changes in scripts/:

			A few scripts have been removed, other added and some
			revised/rewritten/replaced.
